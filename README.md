RadiusDESK Installer
====================
This is a shell script that tries to simplify or ease the process of installing [RadiusDESK](http://www.radiusdesk.com) on a CentOS 6.X (32 bit/64 bit) machine. This is something I cooked up with the hope of supporting it and making it better as time goes on.

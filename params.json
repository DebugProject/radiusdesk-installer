This will be an ongoing effort and there is plans to support more Distros (Fedora,Debian,Ubuntu etc) and so please feel free to contribute by sending a pull request.\r\n\r\n### Installation & Usage\r\n1. Clone or download the project.\r\n\r\n   a) If you have git already installed, just use `git clone git clone https://github.com/muffycompo/radiusdesk-installer.git`. **Note:** you can install git on RHEL/CentOS 6.x via yum (`yum install -y wget unzip`)\r\n   \r\n   b) If you prefer to download the zip file `wget -cL https://github.com/muffycompo/radiusdesk-installer/archive/master.zip`. **Note:** just make sure you have **wget** and **unzip** installed (`yum install -y wget unzip`)\r\n2. Run/execute the Installer script as **root** `cd radiusdesk-installer; ./rd_installer.sh` and choose your preferred web server (**Nginx** or **Apache**)\r\n3. Grab yourself a cup of Coffee as the installer installs all the components required to have a working RADIUSdesk server.\r\n4. When the script is done installing and configuring your system, we recommend rebooting your machine/server to ensure everything is persistent on reboot.\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n1. The installer only works RADIUSdesk on a RHEL/CentOS 6.x machines/servers\r\n2. Installer assumes default installation values (Database passwords, FreeRADIUS secrets etc)\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n1. [RADIUSdesk Course/Tutorials](http://www.maomuffy.com/introduction-to-radiusdesk-with-rhelcentos-6-x-mini-course/) by [Mfawa Alfred Onen](http://ng.linkedin.com/in/mfawaalfredonen/)\r\n2. [RADIUSdesk Project](http://www.radiusdesk.com) by [Dirk van der Walt](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dirk-van-der-walt/11/b64/79a)\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n1. Make the installer Operating System agnostic (Support multiple Linux OS)\r\n2. Modularize installer code (maybe look at using Puppet)\r\n\r\n### Contributions\r\n1. Anyone is welcome to contribute by sending a pull request with your desired feature tested and implemented.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with RADIUSdesk?
